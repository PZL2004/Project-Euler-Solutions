Hi!

This is where my solutions to Project Euler are written. I am doing this to practice my C++ and Python skills more.

A lot of the time this requires knowledge outside of coding, so what I'll do is research a method I have either heard of before or learned, and then implement it within code.

Some of the code is probably similar to others in structure as I have skimmed through pseudocode and watched videos on the topic for a few of these. Some code has been optimized/shortened using methods from other sources. However, it was all adapted and written by me for the problem at hand.
