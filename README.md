Hi!

This is where my solutions to Project Euler are written. I am doing this to practice my C++ and Python skills more.

A lot of the time this requires knowledge outside of coding, so what I'll do is research a method I have either heard of before or learned, and then implement it within code.

Some of this will also look like other people's code. I have looked at pseudocode for some of these. Additionally, I have probably used functions from libraries other people have most likely used to complete the problems; most likely causing similarities.
